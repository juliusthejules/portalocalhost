## About Portalocalhost

Portalocalhost is an anonymizer and privacy-focused project designed to enhance online anonymity and security. By simply keeping the Portalocalhost window open, users can enjoy a higher level of privacy without any additional action required. The project is the culmination of a three-phase plan aimed at providing flexible, non-permanent privacy configurations for users.

## What it does

Portalocalhost modifies various device and network settings to maximize online privacy and anonymity. It achieves this by applying configurations such as disabling location services, setting DNS servers to localhost, and clearing cache and cookies. Additionally, it anonymizes network identifiers by setting the MAC and Bluetooth addresses to all zeros.

## Key features

- **Network Configuration**: Sets hostname, IPv4, and IPv6 addresses to localhost.
- **Disable Location and Pings**: Turns off location services and ICMP pings.
- **DNS Configuration**: Sets primary and secondary DNS servers to localhost.
- **Cache Management**: Disables and clears cache to prevent data leaks.
- **Cookie Management**: Disables cookies and clears all existing cookies from various browsers.
- **MAC and Bluetooth Address Configuration**: Sets MAC and Bluetooth addresses to all zeros for anonymity.
